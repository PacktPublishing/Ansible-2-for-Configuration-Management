# Ansible 2 for Configuration Management, Video 1.3

This folder contains instructions for installing Ansible.

Ansible uses Python and currently supports both Python 2 and Python 3.

## Prerequisites

You need a Linux machine with `pip` installed. For example, on Ubuntu 18.04,
using Python 3:

```
sudo apt install -y python3-pip
```

Note that for a new machine you may need to update the package repository cache
with `sudo apt update` first.

## Installing

Install with pip:

```
sudo pip3 install ansible
```

If you are using Python 2, you will need to run:

```
sudo pip install ansible
```
